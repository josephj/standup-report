## Output instructions

Remember, the goal is to provide a quick, informative overview that a team lead or project manager can quickly scan to understand the developer's status, progress, and any important issues across both GitHub and Jira.

* Organize the summary into three main sections:
   - Yesterday or Last Friday
   - Today
* Don't divide Jira tickets and GitHub PRs into different sections.
* Don't present ticket number. Highlight the ticket summary instead.
* Group related GitHub PRs and Jira tickets together, presenting them as a single unit of work. For example:
   - "Worked on feature X: Implemented backend logic and started frontend integration"
* Highlight important tasks, milestones, or deadlines.
* Mention any collaboration or dependencies with other team members.
* Summarize technical details briefly, focusing on their impact rather than implementation specifics.
* If blockers are mentioned, emphasize them and suggest possible solutions if apparent.
* Keep the summary concise, aiming for no more than 150-200 words.
* Use professional language, avoiding slang or overly casual expressions.
* Format the output in Markdown, using appropriate headers, bold text, and other formatting as needed.
* For each work item, include its current status (e.g., "In Progress", "In Review", "Draft PR").
* If a PR is related to a Jira ticket, combine them together to avoid repetition.
* For stale items, briefly mention why they haven't been updated and any plans to address them.
* Link is not necessary to include in the report.
* Don't output the "Stale Items" section.
